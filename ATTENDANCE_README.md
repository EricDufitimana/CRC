## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Students not appearing in list**
   - Check if students are assigned to the selected class
   - Verify student data in database

2. **Attendance not saving**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoint is accessible
   - Check database permissions

3. **Slow loading**
   - Check database query performance
   - Consider implementing pagination for large datasets

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` and checking browser console and server logs.
